#### OWNERSHIP TRANSFER ATTRIBUTES <a id="ownership-transfer-attributes"></a>

1. Users can claim ownership of Unowned records. When a user requests ownership with their group ID, the user's group will be automatically assigned to the record.
2. Users can request ownership transfer for records that are already assigned to a group. When a user initiates an ownership transfer, a request is sent to the members of the record's current owner group. These members must review and approve the request in VinylDNS. Approvers will also receive an email notification about the pending transfer.
