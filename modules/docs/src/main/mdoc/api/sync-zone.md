# Sync Zone

Used to sync VinylDNS zone info with existing zone info.  When a sync is performed, a zone transfer is initiated with the backend DNS server.
The backend data is compared to the existing data in VinylDNS.  If there are any differences, the _backend DNS Server_ is considered
the source of truth and will overwrite the data in VinylDNS.  All changes will be recorded in VinylDNS so they can be seen in the
zone history.

While the zone is syncing, the zone will be _unavailable_ for updates (read-only).

We have done some testing on how long syncs take.  These will vary with usage:

- 1000 records ~ 1 second
- 10,000 records ~ 10 seconds
- 100,000 records ~ 6 minutes

Please keep these numbers in mind when you perform syncs.
