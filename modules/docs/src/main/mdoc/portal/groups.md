## Groups

Groups are the primary way users are granted access to zones. Users can create groups for two purposes in VinylDNS: to be the zone admin group for a zone or to be assigned more limited access via [ACL rules](manage-access.html). Every zone in VinylDNS must have a zone admin group assigned. VinylDNS does not currently integrate with any services to generate pre-defined zone admin groups.
