# API Configuration Guide

**Note: ALL configuration assumes a `vinyldns` namespace. For example, sqs settings would be under `vinyldns.sqs`.**

## Configuration

- [Full Example Config](#full-example-config)

There are a lot of configuration settings in VinylDNS. So much so that it may seem overwhelming to configure vinyldns to
your environment. This document describes the configuration settings, highlighting the settings you are _most likely to
change_. All the configuration settings are captured at the end.

It is important to note that the `api` and `portal` have _different_ configuration. We will review the configuration for
each separately.

## Configuration Overview

### How do we config?

All configuration is done using [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config). It provides a means to
specifying default configurations, and overriding the configured values in a number of ways:

1. The _default_ configuration provides "safe" default values for all configuration. This makes it possible for you to
   only change the configuration values that you _need_ to, and assume the _default_ for the rest. This can typically be
   found in a file named `reference.conf`. The Typesafe Config library manages populating unspecified values for you
   automatically.
1. You can override the `reference.conf` file by providing your own `application.conf` file when the system starts up.
   We will review how to do that in the sections that follow.
1. You can override _individual_ configuration properties when the application starts up using standard jvm arguments.
   For example, you can specify `-Dmy.config.value=42`, and that will override _both_ application.conf _and_
   reference.conf (defaults)
1. You can further override configuration properties with _environment variables_. The Typesafe Config provides special
   syntax that allows you to use environment variables. You can make the environment variable optional (meaning use it
   if it is there)
   or required (fail to start up without the environment variable). We will illustrate use of environment variables in
   this guide.

### Using Environment Variables

We _strongly_ recommend that you use environment variables in particular for secrets. Laying down environment variables
in a flat file is a security vulnerability for your installation. To demonstrate environment variable usage, here is a
following snippet...

```yaml
  queue.settings {
     access-key = ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}
     secret-key = ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
     signing-region = ${SQS_REGION}
     service-endpoint = ${SQS_SERVICE_ENDPOINT}
     queue-name = ${SQS_QUEUE_NAME}
  }
```

In the example, if any of the values in `${xxx}` are not found in the environment, the application will not start up!

## Configuring API Server

The API configuration has a lot of values, the important ones reviewed here. There are several configuration settings
that are specific to _your_ environment.

The most important configuration is around your system dependencies. Presently, these are your settings for:

* `AWS SQS`
* `MySQL`

## Queue Configuration

VinylDNS supports both SQS and MySQL queue implementations.

There are a couple of implementation-dependent settings that need to be specified:

* `messages-per-poll`: Number of messages retrieved in a single queue receive request. Valid values are 1 through 10 (
  default).
* `polling-interval`: Interval to delay between each poll for messages.

If using SQS, be sure to follow the [AWS SQS Setup Guide](setup-sqs.html) first to get the values you need to configure
here.

If using MySQL, follow the [MySQL Setup Guide](setup-mysql.html) first to get the values you need to configure here.

The following in a sample SQS config:

```yaml
vinyldns {

  queue {
     class-name = "vinyldns.sqs.queue.SqsMessageQueueProvider"
   
     messages-per-poll = 10
     polling-interval = 250.millis
   
     # connection information to SQS
     settings {
        # AWS access key and secret.
        access-key = "x"
        secret-key = "x"
      
        # Regional endpoint to make your requests (eg. 'us-west-2', 'us-east-1', etc.). This is the region where your queue is housed.
        signing-region = "x"
      
        # Endpoint to access queue
        service-endpoint = "http://vinyldns-elasticmq:9324/"
      
        # Queue name. Should be used in conjunction with service endpoint, rather than using a queue url which is subject to change.
        queue-name = "vinyldns"
     }
  }
}
```

The following is a sample MySQL queue config:

```yaml
queue {
  class-name = "vinyldns.mysql.queue.MySqlMessageQueueProvider"

  polling-interval = 250.millis
  messages-per-poll = 10
  max-retries = 50 # Override max retries; default = 100

  settings = {
     name = "vinyldns"
     driver = "org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"
     migration-url = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:19004/?user=root&password=pass"
     url = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:19004/vinyldns?user=root&password=pass"
     user = "root"
     password = "pass"
   
     # see https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP
     connection-timeout-millis = 1000
     idle-timeout = 10000
     max-lifetime = 30000
     maximum-pool-size = 5
     minimum-idle = 0
   
     my-sql-properties = {
        cachePrepStmts=true
        prepStmtCacheSize=250
        prepStmtCacheSqlLimit=2048
        rewriteBatchedStatements=true
     }
  }
}
```

## Database Configuration

VinylDNS supports a MySQL database. You can enable all repos in a single backend, or have a mix of the two. For each
backend, you need to configure the table(s) that should be loaded.

If using MySQL, follow the [MySQL Setup Guide](setup-mysql.html) first to get the values you need to configure here.

```yaml
vinyldns {

  # this list should include only the datastores being used by your instance
  data-stores = ["mysql"]

  mysql {
   
     # this is the path to the mysql provider. This should not be edited
     # from the default in reference.conf
     class-name = "vinyldns.mysql.repository.MySqlDataStoreProvider"
   
     settings {
        # the name of the database, recommend to leave this as is
        name = "vinyldns"
      
        # the jdbc driver, recommended to leave this as is
        driver = "org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"
      
        # the URL used to create the schema, typically this will be without the "database" name
        migration-url = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:19002/?user=root&password=pass"
      
        # the main connection URL
        url = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:19002/vinyldns?user=root&password=pass"
      
        # the user to connect to MySQL
        user = "root"
      
        # the password to connect to MySQL
        password = "pass"
      
        ## see https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP for more detail on the following fields
        # the maximum number of connections to scale the connection pool to
        maximum-pool-size = 20
      
        # the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a connection from the connection pool
        connection-timeout-millis = 1000
      
        # the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool
        minimum-idle = 10
      
        # the maximum number of milliseconds that a connection is can sit idle in the pool
        idle-timeout = 10000
      
        # The max lifetime of a connection in a pool.  Should be several seconds shorter than the database imposed connection time limit
        max-lifetime = 600000
      
        # controls whether JMX MBeans are registered
        register-mbeans = true
      
        # my-sql-properties allows you to include any additional mysql performance settings you want.
        # Note that the properties within my-sql-properties must be camel case!
        # see https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/MySQL-Configuration for guidance
        my-sql-properties {
        prepStmtCacheSize = 300
        prepStmtCacheSqlLimit = 2048
        cachePrepStmts = true
        useServerPrepStmts = true
        rewriteBatchedStatements = true
        }
     }
   
     repositories {
        # all repositories with config sections here will be enabled in mysql
        zone {
        # no additional settings for repositories enabled in mysql
        }
        batch-change {
        }
        user {
        }
        record-set {
        }
        record-set-cache {
        }
     }
  }

}
```

## Cryptography Settings

VinylDNS uses symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt/decrypt sensitive information in the system. This includes TSIG
keys and user secrets. Cryptography is used in _both_ the portal as well as the api.

Cryptography is _pluggable_, meaning you can bring your own crypto with you. All that is required is to provide an
implementation
of [CryptoAlgebra](https://github.com/vinyldns/vinyldns/blob/master/modules/core/src/main/scala/vinyldns/core/crypto/CryptoAlgebra.scala)
using a crypto library of choice. The default implementation is `NoOpCrypto`, which does not do any encryption (not
recommended for production). VinylDNS provides a cryptography implementation called `JavaCrypto` that you can use for
production. The example that follows illustrates using the provided `JavaCrypto`.

If you create your own implementation, you have to build your jar and make it (and all dependencies) available to the
VinylDNS API and the VinylDNS portal.

The following are the configuration settings for crypto. Notice here the _only_ thing we see is the `type`. The `type`
is the fully qualified class name for the `CryptoAlgebra` you will be using. If your crypto implementation requires
additional settings, they will be configured inside the `crypto` element, adjacent to the `type`.

```yaml
vinyldns {
  crypto {
     type = "vinyldns.core.crypto.JavaCrypto"
     secret = "8B06A7F3BC8A2497736F1916A123AA40E88217BE9264D8872597EF7A6E5DCE61"
  }
}
```

## Zone Connections

VinylDNS has three ways of indicating zone connections:

1. Global default connection applies to all zones unless overridden by one of the following connections. This
   configuration is required.
2. Backends allows you to specify zone connection information for an individual zone by choosing a pre-configured zone
   connection. This configuration is optional.
3. Zone level override allows you to specify zone update and transfer connection information _for each zone_. More
   information is in the [Zone Model](../api/zone-model.html).

VinylDNS has **2** connections for each zone:

1. The DDNS connection - used for making DDNS updates to the zone
1. The Transfer connection - used for making AXFR requests for zone syncing with the DNS backend

VinylDNS also ties in testing network connectivity to the default zone connection's primary server into its API health
checks. A value for the health check connection timeout in milliseconds can be specified using `health-check-timeout`; a
default value of 10000 will be used if not provided.

### Global Zone Connections Configuration:
```yaml
vinyldns {

  # timeout for DNS backend connectivity health check
  health-check-timeout = 5000

  # the DDNS connection information for the default dns backend
  defaultZoneConnection {
     # this is not really used, but must be set, usually set to the keyName itself, or a descriptive name if you are interested
     name = "vinyldns."
   
     # the name of the TSIG key
     keyName = "vinyldns."
   
     # the TSIG secret key
     key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
   
     # the host name or IP address, note you can add a port if not using the default by settings hostname:port
     primaryServer = "ddns1.foo.bar.com"
   
     # the key algorithm to use: HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, HMAC-SHA512
     algorithm = "HMAC-MD5"
  }

  # the AXFR connection information for the default dns backend
  defaultTransferConnection {
     name = "vinyldns."
     keyName = "vinyldns."
     key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
     primaryServer = "localhost:19001"
     algorithm = "HMAC-MD5"
  }
}

  # Zone Connection Data, ID can be specified in a zone to override the global default configuration
  backends = [
     {
        id = "test-backend-id"
        zone-connection {
        name = "vinyldns."
        key-name = "vinyldns."
        key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
        primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
        algorithm = "HMAC-MD5"
     }
     transfer-connection {
        name = "vinyldns."
        key-name = "vinyldns."
        key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
        primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
        algorithm = "HMAC-MD5"
     }
  }
]
```

### Alternate Zone Connections Configuration:
Below is an alternate way of setting zone connections configuration instead of using the [Global Zone Connections
Configuration](#global-zone-connections-configuration)
```yaml
# configured backend providers
backend {
# Use "default" when dns backend legacy = true
# otherwise, use the id of one of the connections in any of your backends
default-backend-id = "default"

# this is where we can save additional backends
backend-providers = [
  {
    class-name = "vinyldns.api.backend.dns.DnsBackendProviderLoader"
    settings = {
      legacy = false
      backends = [
        {
          id = "default"
          zone-connection = {
            name = "vinyldns."
            key-name = "vinyldns."
            key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
            primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
          }
          transfer-connection = {
            name = "vinyldns."
            key-name = "vinyldns."
            key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
            primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
          },
          tsig-usage = "always"
        },
        {
          id = "func-test-backend"
          zone-connection = {
            name = "vinyldns."
            key-name = "vinyldns."
            key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
            primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
          }
          transfer-connection = {
            name = "vinyldns."
            key-name = "vinyldns."
            key = "nzisn+4G2ldMn0q1CV3vsg=="
            primary-server = "127.0.0.1:19001"
          },
          tsig-usage = "always"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
}
```

Below is an example configuration of backend provider for AWS Route 53, in case we want to use AWS Route 53 as backend.
```yaml
backend {
    default-backend-id = "r53"

    backend-providers = [
      {
        class-name = "vinyldns.route53.backend.Route53BackendProviderLoader"
        settings = {
          backends = [
            {
                # AWS access key and secret key.
                access-key = "your-access-key"
                secret-key = "your-secret-key"

                # Regional endpoint to make your requests (eg. 'us-west-2', 'us-east-1', etc.). This is the region where your queue is housed.
                signing-region = "us-east-1"

                # Endpoint to access r53
                service-endpoint = "https://route53.amazonaws.com/"

                id = "r53"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
Make sure to add AWS name servers in [Approved Name Servers Config](#approved-name-servers).

## Additional Configuration Settings

### Approved Name Servers

When running a large DNS installation, allowing users the ability to self-manage zone delegations can lead to a lot of
problems when not done properly. Also, allowing delegation to untrusted DNS servers can be a security risk.

To "lock down" zone delegation, you can configure name servers that you trust, so zone delegation is controlled.

The entries in the list can be host names, IP addresses, or regular expressions.

```yaml
approved-name-servers = [
  "172.17.42.1.",
  "ddns1.foo.bar.",
  ".*awsdns.*"
]
```

### Processing Disabled

The processing disabled flag can be used if doing a blue/green deployment. When processing is disabled, the VinylDNS
engine will _not_ be actively polling the message queue for messages.

`processing-disabled = false | true`

### Color

For blue-green deployments, you can configure the color of the current node. Not applicable to every environment.

`color = "green"`

### Version

Version of the application that is deployed. Currently, this is a configuration value.

`version = "0.8.0"`

**Note: You can get installation information including color, version, default key name, and processing-disabled by
hitting the _status_ endpoint GET /status**

### Is Zone Sync Schedule Allowed

Used while deploying. Should be set to `true` only on one api server/instance and `false` on every other api servers/instances. 
Thus automated sync will be done only once on a single server/instance instead of every api servers/instances.
Set it to `true` while running locally or when we have only a single api server/instance.

`is-zone-sync-schedule-allowed = true`

### HTTP Host and Port

To specify what host and port to bind to when starting up the API server, default is 9000.

```yaml
rest {
  host = "0.0.0.0"
  port = 9000
}
```

### Sync Delay

VinylDNS uses a "sync-delay" setting that prevents users from syncing their zones too frequently. The settings is
inspected _per zone_, and is the number of milliseconds since the _last_ sync to wait before allowing another sync for
_that_ zone.

```yaml
sync-delay = 10000
```

### Notifiers

VinylDNS provides the ability to send notifications via configured notifiers when a batch change is either implemented
or rejected. Notifiers in VinylDNS are designed to be pluggable (ie. bring-your-own-implementation), granting users the
flexibility to implement their own which can smoothly integrate into their instance.

Setup requires a `notifiers` key which contains all of the configured notifiers that will be used by the running
instance.

```yaml
notifiers = ["email", "sns"]
```

#### E-mail notifier

Configuration for the e-mail notifier appears like the following:

```yaml
email = {
   # Path to notifier provider implementation
   class-name = "vinyldns.api.notifier.email.EmailNotifierProvider"

   settings = {
      # Sender address for e-mail notifications
      from = "Sender <do-not-reply@example.sender>"

      smtp {
         # Host SMTP server
         portal {
            url= "http://127.0.0.1:9001" # portal uri for email link
         }
         host = "example.host"
         # if smtp host requires authentication we can enable auth
         auth = true
         username = sampleUser
         password = samplePassword
         starttls.enable = true
      }
   }
}
```

Note that `settings.from` and `settings.smtp` are both required, though the `smtp` values requirements depend on the
specific exchange service that you are interfacing with.

Below is an example e-mail notification:

![Sample E-mail Notification](../img/sample-email-nofitication.png)

#### AWD Simple Notification Service (SNS) notifier

Configuration for the AWS SNS notifier appears like the following:

```yaml
sns {
  # Path to notifier provider implementation
  class-name = "vinyldns.api.notifier.sns.SnsNotifierProvider"

  settings {
  # SNS topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
  topic-arn = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:000000000000:batchChanges"

  # AWS access key and secret
  access-key = "vinyldnsTest"
  secret-key = "notNeededForSnsLocal"

  # Endpoint to access SNS
  service-endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:19006"

  # Regional endpoint to make your requests (eg. 'us-west-2', 'us-east-1', etc.). This is the region where your SNS is housed.
  signing-region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```
### Email Domain Configuration
 This configuration setting determines the valid domains which are 
 allowed in the email fields.

 The `email-domains` field accepts a list of valid email domains. Wildcard matching 
 is available; for example, `*dummy.com` means it will allow any 
 subdomain within dummy.com like test.dummy.com. If the `email-domains` field is
 left empty then it will accept any domain name. 
 
The `number-of-dots` field controls the number of dots allowed after the `@` symbol in 
an email. If this config value is left out, it will default to two.
```yaml
valid-email-config {
   email-domains = ["test.com","*dummy.com"]
   number-of-dots= 2
}
  ``` 

### Batch Manual Review Enabled <a id="manual-review" />

[manual-review]: #manual-review

Configuration setting that determines whether batch changes with non-fatal errors can be reviewed rather than failing
immediately. When enabling manual review, the expectation is that a DNS technician is actively querying and addressing
batch change requests that are in a manual review state. If your process flow does not accommodate this expectation, we
advise disabling manual review.

```yaml
manual-batch-review-enabled = true
```

### Manual Review Domains

Configuration setting that determines what Batch Change/DNS Change input names require manual review
if `manual-batch-review-enabled` is set to `true`. If `manual-batch-review-enabled` is set to `false` any input names
that match entries in the configured list will be treated as fatal errors.

```yaml
manual-review-domains = {
  domain-list = [
     "needs-review.*"
  ]
  ip-list = [
     "192.0.2.254",
     "192.0.2.255",
     "fd69:27cc:fe91:0:0:0:ffff:1",
     "fd69:27cc:fe91:0:0:0:ffff:2"
  ]
  zone-name-list = [
     "zone.requires.review."
  ]
}
```

### Scheduled Batch Changes Enabled

Configuration setting that determines if users are able to make Batch Changes with a scheduled
time. `manual-batch-review-enabled` must be enabled as well. If enabled, a VinylDNS administrator cannot approve the
Batch Change until after the scheduled time. An administrator could also reject the Batch Change.

```yaml
scheduled-changes-enabled = true
```

### IPv6 Zone Discovery Boundaries

Configuration setting that determines the range that will be searched for in reverse IPv6 Zone Discovery. This allows
you to limit the search for what is appropriate for your organization. For example, min = 2, max = 3 will only search in
zones in the form `X.X.ip6.arpa.` and `X.X.X.ip6.arpa.`. Note the following constraints: 0 < min <= max <= 32. If your
organization only makes zone cuts at one point, you may set min == max.

The default values if omitted are min = 5, max = 20.

```yaml
v6-discovery-nibble-boundaries {
  min = 5
  max = 20
}
```

### Dotted Hosts

Configuration setting that determines the zones, users (either individual or based on group) and record types that are 
allowed to create dotted hosts. If only all the above are satisfied, one can create a dotted host in VinylDNS.

Note the following:
1. Zones defined in the `zone` must always end with a dot. Eg: `comcast.com.`
2. Wildcard character `*` can be used in `zone` to allow dotted hosts for all zones matching it.
3. Individual users who are allowed to create dotted hosts are added to the `user-list` using their username.
4. A set of users in a group who are allowed to create dotted hosts are added to the `group-list` using group name.
5. If the user is either in `user-list` or `group-list`, they are allowed to create a dotted host. It is
not necessary for the user to be in both `user-list` and `group-list`.
6. The record types which are allowed while creating a dotted host is added to the `record-types`.
7. The number of dots allowed in a record name for a zone is given in `dots-limit`.
8. If `user-list` is left empty (`user-list = []`), no user will be allowed to create dotted hosts unless 
they're present in `group-list` and vice-versa. If both `user-list` and `group-list` is left empty
no users will be allowed to create dotted hosts in that zone.
9. If `record-types` is left empty (`record-types = []`), user cannot create dotted hosts of any record type
in that zone.
10. If `dots-limit` is set to 0 (`dots-limit = 0`), we cannot create dotted hosts record in that zone.

```yaml
# approved zones, individual users, users in groups, record types and no.of.dots that are allowed for dotted hosts
dotted-hosts = {
   allowed-settings = [
      {
      zone = "dummy."
      user-list = ["testuser"]
      group-list = ["dummy-group"]
      record-types = ["AAAA"]
      dots-limit = 3
      },
      {
      # for wildcard zones. Settings will be applied to all matching zones
      zone = "*ent.com."
      user-list = ["professor", "testuser"]
      group-list = ["testing-group"]
      record-types = ["A", "CNAME"]
      dots-limit = 3
      }
   ]
}
```

In the above, the dotted hosts can be created only in the zone `dummy.` and zones matching `*ent.com.` (parent.com., child.parent.com.)

Also, it must satisfy the allowed users or group users and record type of the respective zone to create a dotted host.

For eg, we can't create a dotted host with `CNAME` record type in the zone `dummy.` as it's not in `record-types`.
And the user `professor` can't create a dotted host in the zone `dummy.` as the user is not in `user-list` or 
`group-list` (not part of `dummy-group`).

The config can be left empty as follows if we don't want to use it:

```yaml
dotted-hosts = {
   allowed-settings = []
}
```
