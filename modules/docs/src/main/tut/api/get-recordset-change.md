# Get RecordSet Change

RecordSet changes (Create, Update, Delete) are not immediately applied to the DNS backend; they are queued up for processing.  Most changes are applied within a few seconds.
When you submit a change for processing, the response is a Change model.  You can use the information in that change model in order to poll for the status of the change until it completes (status = Complete) or fails (status = Failed)

#### HTTP REQUEST

> GET /zones/{zoneId}/recordsets/{recordSetId}/changes/{recordChangeId}

#### HTTP RESPONSE TYPES

Code          | description |
 ------------ | :---------- |
200           | **OK** - The record set change is returned in the response body
401           | **Unauthorized** - The authentication information provided is invalid.  Typically the request was not signed properly, or the access key and secret used to sign the request are incorrect |
403           | **Forbidden** - The user does not have the access required to perform the action |
404           | **Not Found** - The zone, record set, or change was not found |
