#### BATCH CHANGE INFORMATION <a id="batchchange-info" />

Batch change is an alternative to submitting individual [RecordSet](../api/recordset-model) changes and provides the following:

-   The ability to accept multiple changes in a single API call.
-   The ability to include records of multiple record types across multiple zones.
-   Input names are entered as fully-qualified domain names (or IP addresses for **PTR** records), so users don't have to think in record/zone context.
-   All record validations are processed simultaneously. [Fatal errors](../api/batchchange-errors#fatal-errors) for any
change in the batch will result in a **400** response and none will be applied.
-   Support for [manual review](../../operator/config-api#additional-configuration-settings) if enabled in your VinylDNS instance.
Batch change will remain in limbo until a system administrator (ie. support or super user) either rejects it resulting in
an immediate failure or approves it resulting in revalidation and submission for processing.
-   Support for [notifications](../../operator/config-api#additional-configuration-settings) when a batch change is rejected or implemented.

A batch change consists of multiple single changes which can be a combination of [SingleAddChanges](#singleaddchange-attributes) and [SingleDeleteRRSetChanges](#singledeleterrsetchange-attributes).

**Note:** In the portal batch change is referred to as [DNS Change](../portal/dns-changes).

To update an existing record, you must delete the record first and add the record again with the updated changes.

Batch changes are also susceptible to the following restrictions:
-   Current supported record types for batch change are: **A**, **AAAA**, **CNAME**, and **PTR**.
-   Batch change requests must contain at least one change.
-   The maximum number of single changes within a batch change is currently set to 20.
-   Access permissions will follow existing rules (admin group or ACL access). Note that an update (delete and add of the same record name, zone and record type combination) requires **Write** access.

#### SINGLE CHANGE ATTRIBUTES <a id="singlechange-attributes" />

A successful batch change response consists of a corresponding [SingleAddChange](#singleaddchange-attributes) or [SingleDeleteRRSetChange](#singledeleterrsetchange-attributes) for each batch change input. See the [batch change create](../api/create-batchchange) page for details on constructing a batch change request.

#### ChangeType Values <a id="changetype-values" />
There are two valid `changeType`s for a `SingleChange`: **Add** and **DeleteRecordSet**

`changeType`s can be used independently or combined to achieve the desired behavior described below.

- Create a new DNS record: **Add** with record data
- Delete an entire record set: 1. **DeleteRecordSet** without specifying existing record data *or* 2. **DeleteRecordSet** for each entry of the DNS record
- Delete a single entry from DNS record with multiple entries: **DeleteRecordSet** specifying existing record data
- Update an existing record set: 1. **DeleteRecordSet** specifying existing record data (single entry delete) or not specifying record data (full delete) *and* 2. **Add** with record data
