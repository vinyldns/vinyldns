#### BATCH CHANGE INFORMATION <a id="batchchange-info" />

Batch change is an alternative to submitting individual [RecordSet](../api/recordset-model) changes and provides the following:

-   The ability to accept multiple changes in a single API call.
-   The ability to include records of multiple record types across multiple zones.
-   Input names are entered as fully-qualified domain names (or IP addresses for **PTR** records), so users don't have to think in record/zone context.
-   All record validations are processed simultaneously. [Errors](../api/batchchange-errors/#fail-slow-errors) for any change in the batch will result in a **400** response and none will be applied.

A batch change consists of multiple single changes which can be a combination of [SingleAddChanges](#singleaddchange-attributes) and [SingleDeleteChanges](#singledeletechange-attributes).

To update an existing record, you must delete the record first and add the record again with the updated changes.

Batch changes are also susceptible to the following restrictions:
-   Current supported record types for batch change are: **A**, **AAAA**, **CNAME**, and **PTR**.
-   Batch change requests must contain at least one change.
-   The maximum number of single changes within a batch change is currently set to 20.
-   Access permissions will follow existing rules (admin group or ACL access). Note that an update (delete and add of the same record name, zone and record type combination) requires **Write** access.


#### BATCH CHANGE ATTRIBUTES <a id="batchchange-attributes" />

comments      | string      | Optional comments about the batch change. |
createdTimestamp | date-time      | The timestamp (in GMT) when the batch change was created. |
changes       | Array of SingleChange | Array of single changes within a batch change. A *SingleChange* can either be a [SingleAddChange](#singleaddchange-attributes) or a [SingleDeleteChange](#singledeletechange-attributes). |
status        | BatchChangeStatus | **Pending** - at least one change in batch in still in pending state; **Complete** - all changes are in complete state; **Failed** - all changes are in failure state; **PartialFailure** - some changes have failed and the rest are complete. |

ownerGroupId  | string      | Record ownership assignment. Required if any records in the batch change are in shared zones and are new or unowned. |

#### SINGLE CHANGE ATTRIBUTES <a id="singlechange-attributes" />

A successful batch change response consists of a corresponding [SingleAddChange](#singleaddchange-attributes) or [SingleDeleteChange](#singledeletechange-attributes) for each batch change input. See the [batch change create](../api/create-batchchange) page for details on constructing a batch change request.

inputName     | string        | The fully-qualified domain name of the record which was provided in the create batch request. |
type          | RecordType    | Type of DNS record, supported records for batch changes are currently: **A**, **AAAA**, **CNAME**, and **PTR**. |

record        | [RecordData](../api/recordset-model/#record-data)    | The data added for this record, which varies by record type. | 
status        | SingleChangeStatus | Status for this change. Can be one of: **Pending**, **Complete** or **Failed**. |
recordName    | string        | The name of the record. Record names for the apex will be match the zone name (including terminating dot). |

zoneId        | string        | The unique identifier for the zone. |
systemMessage | string        | Conditional: Returns system message relevant to corresponding batch change input. |
recordChangeId| string        | Conditional: The unique identifier for the record change; only returned on successful batch creation. |
recordSetId   | string        | Conditional: The unique identifier for the record set; only returned on successful batch creation, |
id            | string        | The unique identifier for this change. |
