# Batch Change Errors
- [Single Change Errors](#single-change-errors)
   - [Non-Fatal Errors](#non-fatal-errors)
   - [Fatal Errors](#fatal-errors)
- [Full-Request Errors](#full-request-errors)

### SINGLE CHANGE ERRORS <a id="single-change-errors" />
Single change errors are errors that get collected at different validation stages and correspond to individual
change inputs. Each change can have its own list of one or more errors. Single change errors are grouped into the following stages:

- Independent input validations: Validate invalid data input formats and values.
- Record and zone discovery: Resolve record and zone from fully-qualified input name.
- Dependent context validations: Check for sufficient user access and conflicts with existing records or other submissions within the batch.

Since single change errors are collected at different stages, errors at later stages may exist but will not
appear unless errors at earlier stages are addressed. An example is that a user may initially get an error about required data
missing from the DNS request, and then after correcting the data encounter an issue about a conflicting record already existing
in the DNS backend.

#### EXAMPLE ERROR RESPONSE BY CHANGE <a id="batchchange-error-response-by-change" />


```
[
   {
      "changeType": "Add",
      "inputName": "good-A.another.example.com.",
      "type": "A",
      "ttl": 200,
      "record": {
        "address": "1.2.3.4"
      }
   },
   {
      "changeType": "Add",
      "inputName": "duplicate.example.com",
      "type": "CNAME",
      "ttl": 200,
      "record": {
         "cname": "test.example.com."
      },
      "errors": [
         "Record with name "duplicate.example.com." is not unique in the batch change. CNAME record cannot use duplicate name."
      ]
   },
   {
      "changeType": "Add",
      "inputName": "duplicate.example.com",
      "type": "A",
      "ttl": 300,
      "record": {
         "address": "1.2.3.4"
      }
   },
   {
      "changeType": "Add",
      "inputName": "bad-ttl-and-invalid-name$.sample.com.‚Äù,
      "type": "A",
      "ttl": 29,
      "record": {
         "address": "1.2.3.4"
      },
      "errors": [
         "Failed validation 29, TTL must be between 30 and 2147483647.",
         "Failed validation bad-ttl-and-invalid-name$.sample.com., valid domain names are a series of one or more labels joined by dots and terminate on a dot."
      ]
   }
]
```

#### Single Change Errors
Single change errors can be further classified as *non-fatal* or *fatal* errors. The presence of one or more fatal
errors will result in an immediate failure (ie. hard stop) and no changes in the batch will be accepted. The behavior of non-fatal errors depends
on whether [manual review is configured on](../../operator/config-api#additional-configuration-settings): if manual review
is disabled, non-fatal errors are treated as fatal errors; if manual review is enabled, batches with only non-fatal errors will enter
a pending review state.

When non-fatal errors are encountered with manual review enabled, the errors will be saved on the corresponding `SingleChange`s.
The `SingleChange`s will also have a `status` of `NeedsReview`.

The following chart provides a breakdown of batch change status outcome based on a combination of manual review
configuration and error types present in the batch change:

Manual Review Enabled? | Errors in Batch?         | Status Outcome |
 :-------------------: | :----------------------- | :------------- |
Yes                    | Both fatal and non-fatal | Hard stop      |
Yes                    | Fatal only               | Hard stop      |
Yes                    | Non-fatal only           | PendingReview  |
Yes                    | No                       | PendingProcessing (will be or is being auto-processed) |
No                     | Both fatal and non-fatal | Hard stop      |
No                     | Fatal only               | Hard stop      |
No                     | Non-fatal only           | Failed         |
No                     | No                       | PendingProcessing (will be or is being auto-processed) |

Note: if a user submits a batch change with `allowManualReview` set to false, the request will treat the request as though
the VinylDNS instance is configured to have manual review disabled.

### Non-Fatal Errors <a id="non-fatal-errors**"></a>
#### Zone Discovery Failed <a id="ZoneDiscoveryFailed"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
Zone Discovery Failed: zone for "<input>" does not exist in VinylDNS. If zone exists, then it must be connected to in VinylDNS.
```

##### Details:

Given an inputName, VinylDNS will determine the record and zone name for the requested change. For most records, the record
names are the same as the zone name (apex), or split at at the first '.', so the inputName 'rname.zone.name.com' will be split
into record name 'rname' and zone name 'zone.name.com' (or 'rname.zone.name.com' for both the record and zone name if it's an apex record).
For PTR records, there is logic to determine the appropriate reverse zone from the given IP address.

If this logic cannot find a matching zone in VinylDNS, you will see this error.
In that case, you need to connect to the zone in VinylDNS.
Even if the zone already exists outside of VinylDNS, it has to be added to VinylDNS to modify records.
VinylDNS also does not support dotted records for forward zones (eg. record `baz.foo.bar.` in zone `bar.`), so encountering
this error could indicate that a zone needs to be created outside of VinylDNS and then connected to within VinylDNS.

### Fatal Errors <a id="fatal-errors"></a>
#### Invalid Domain Name <a id="InvalidDomainName"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
Invalid domain name: "<input>", valid domain names must be letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, joined by dots, and terminate with a dot.
```

##### Details:

Fully qualified domain names, must be comprised of **labels**, separated by dots.
A **label** is a combination of letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
They must also be absolute, which means they end with a dot.

Syntax:

```
<domain> ::= <subdomain> | " "

<subdomain> ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>

<label> ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]

<ldh-str> ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>

<let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"

<let-dig> ::= <letter> | <digit>

<letter> ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in
upper case and a through z in lower case

<digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9
```

##### Error Message:

```
Record "<input>" Does Not Exist: cannot delete a record that does not exist.
```

##### Details:

A record with the given name could not be found in VinylDNS.
If the record exists in DNS, then you should [sync the zone](../api/sync-zone) for that record to bring VinylDNS up to date with what is in the DNS backend.


#### CNAME Conflict <a id="CNAMEConflict"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
CNAME conflict: CNAME record names must be unique. Existing record with name "<name>" and type "<type>" conflicts with this record.

##### Error Message:

```
Invalid Record Type In Reverse Zone: record with name "<name>" and type "<type>" is not allowed in a reverse zone.
```

##### Details:

Not all record types are allowed in a DNS reverse zone. The given type is not supported.


#### Missing Owner Group Id <a id="MissingOwnerGroupId"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
Zone "<zone name>" is a shared zone, so owner group ID must be specified for record "<record name>".
```

##### Details:

You are trying to create a new record or update an existing unowned record in a shared zone. This requires a record owner group ID in the batch change.  


#### Not a Member of Owner Group <a id="NotAMemberOfOwnerGroup"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
User "<user name>" must be a member of group "<group ID>" to apply this group to batch changes.
```

##### Details:

You must be a member of the group you are assigning for record ownership in the batch change. 



#### High Value Domain <a id="HighValueDomain"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
Record Name "<record name>" is configured as a High Value Domain, so it cannot be modified.
```

##### Details:

You are trying to create a record with a name that is not permitted in VinylDNS.
The list of high value domains is specific to each VinylDNS instance.
You should reach out to your VinylDNS administrators for more information.


#### RecordSet has Multiple DNS records <a id="ExistingMultiRecordError"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
RecordSet with name <name> and type <type> cannot be updated in a single Batch Change because it contains multiple DNS records (<count>).
```

##### Details:

This error means that the recordset you are attempting to update/delete has multiple records within it.

Note that this error is configuration-driven and will only appear if your instance of VinylDNS does not support multi-record batch updates.


#### Cannot Create a RecordSet with Multiple Records <a id="NewMultiRecordError"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
Multi-record recordsets are not enabled for this instance of VinylDNS. Cannot create a new record set with multiple records for inputName <name> and type <type>
```

##### Details:

This error means that you have multiple Add entries with the same name and type in a batch change.

Note that this error is configuration-driven and will only appear if your instance of VinylDNS does not support multi-record batch updates.


#### CNAME at the Zone Apex is not Allowed <a id="CnameApexError"></a>

##### Error Message:

```
CNAME cannot be the same name as zone "<zone_name>".
```

##### Details:

CNAME records cannot be `@` or the same name as the zone.
