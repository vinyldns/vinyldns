# Reject Batch Change

Manually rejects a batch change in pending review status given the batch change ID, resulting in immediate failure. Only
system administrators (ie. support or super user) can manually review a batch change.

Note: If [manual review is disabled](../../operator/config-api#manual-review) in the VinylDNS instance,
users trying to access this endpoint will encounter a **404 Not Found** response since it will not exist.
