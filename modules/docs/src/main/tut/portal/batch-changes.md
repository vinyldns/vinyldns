## Batch Changes
Batch change is an alternative to submitting individual RecordSet changes and provides the following:

* The ability to include records of multiple record types across multiple zones.
* Input names are entered as fully-qualified domain names (or IP addresses for **PTR** records), so users don't have to think in record/zone context.

#### Access
* Access permissions will follow existing rules (admin group or ACL access). Note that an update (delete and add of the same record name, zone and record type combination) requires **Write** or **Delete** access.
* <span class="important">**NEW**</span> **Records in shared zones.** All users are permitted to create new records or update unowned records in shared zones.

#### Supported record types
* Current supported record types for batch change are: **A**, **AAAA**, **CNAME**, **PTR**, **TXT**, and **MX**.
* Additionally, there are **A+PTR** and **AAAA+PTR** types that will be processed as separate A (or AAAA) and PTR changes in the VinylDNS backend. Deletes for **A+PTR** and **AAAA+PTR** require Input Name and Record Data.

#### Requirements
* Batch change requests must contain at least one change.
* The maximum number of single changes within a batch change varies by instance of VinylDNS. Contact your VinylDNS administrators to find the batch change limit for your instance.
* To update an existing record, you must delete the record first and add all expected records within the same batch; a delete and add of the same recordset within a batch change request will be processed as an update.
* When creating a new record in a shared zone, or updating an existing unowned record, a record owner group is required. Once the owner group is assigned only users in that group, zone admins, and users with ACL permissions can modify the record.
