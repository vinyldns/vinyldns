## Manage Access to Zones and Records <a id="access"></a>
### Full Access
Members of a zone admin group have *full* access to all records and permissions in the zone.  Each zone is limited to one admin group.  Typically, this should be a limited set of
users. If you wish to add other users to a group you can do so in the [Groups](manage-membership) section of the portal.

### Limited Access
If you don't want a user to have full access to a zone you can use ACL rules to give them more granular access. With ACL rules, the zone admins can grant individual users or groups read, write or delete access to all records in the zone, or a subset of record names and/or types.
1. Go to the desired zone
