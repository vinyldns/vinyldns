## Manage membership
If you create a group in VinylDNS you are automatically made a member and group manager of the group. To manage the members of the group select the *View* button next to the desired group to view the Membership page.

#### Add members:
In the text box over the table enter the username of the person you want to add to the group. If you want to make them a group manager check the *Is Group Manager?* checkbox. Select the *Add Group Member* button.

#### Delete members:
Select the *Delete* button in the row of the user you wish to remove.

#### Change managerial rights:
Toggle the switch under the *Group Manager* column in the row of the user. The switch to the right and green means the user is a group manager. If the switch is to the left and red it means the user is not an group manager.

#### Relinquish managerial rights:
You can relinquish your managerial rights if there is at least one other group manager in the group. If that condition is met you can toggle the *Group Manager* switch for yourself.

#### Remove yourself from a group:
If you wish to remove yourself entirely from a group there must be at least one other manager of the group. If that condition is met you can select the *Delete* button that corresponds with your username and you will be removed from the group entirely.
