## Manage membership
If you create a group in VinylDNS you are automatically made a member and administrator of the group. To manage the members of the group select the *View* button next to the desired group to view the Membership page.

### To add members:
In the text box over the table enter the username of the person you want to add to the group. If you want to make them an administrator check the *Is Group Manager?* checkbox. Select the *Add Group Member* button.

### To delete members:
Select the *Delete* button in the row of the user you wish to remove.

### To change administrative rights:
Toggle the switch under the Group Manager in the row of the user. The switch to the right and green means the user is an administrator. If the switch is to the left and red it means the user is not an administrator.

### To relinquish administrative rights:
You can relinquish your administrative rights if there is at least one other administrator in the group. If that condition is met you can toggle the Group Manager switch for yourself.

### To remove yourself from a group:
If you wish to remove yourself entirely from a group there must be at least one other manager of the group. If that condition is met you can select the *Delete* button that corresponds with your username and you will be removed from the group entirely.
