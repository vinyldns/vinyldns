The Record View lists *Record Sets*, which are records that have the same
name but different record data.  Not all record types support record sets.

When you make any change, it will be issued *immediately* upon confirming
the change to the DNS backend.

If for any reason the change failed, you can view the change in the *Recent Changes* pane
at the top of the screen, or look at the *Change History* tab to see what went wrong.
The *Additional Info* column will contain details of the change failure.
