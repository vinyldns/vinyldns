## Groups

Groups are the primary way users are granted access to zones. Zone admin groups, as they are more specifically called, are unique to VinylDNS. VinylDNS does not currently integrate with any services to generate pre-defined zone admin groups. Every zone in VinylDNS must have a zone admin group assigned.
