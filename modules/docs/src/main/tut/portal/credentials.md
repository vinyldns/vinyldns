## Credentials
In order to use [tooling](/tools) to access VinylDNS, all users must download their credentials from the VinylDNS
portal. The credentials are located in the User Menu in the top right corner of the site after login.

### Regenerate Credentials
If your credentials are compromised you can generate new ones. In the User Menu select *Regenerate Credentials*.
Regenerating your credentials will invalidate your previous credentials. If you are using any VinylDNS tools beyond the
portal you can then select *Download Credentials* to retrieve your new credentials and update the tools you use.
