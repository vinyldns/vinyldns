  * Used for deployment, determines the current color of this node / cluster
  *
  * When we deploy, we will set the color in the config file based on the group of the server (blue or green).
  *
  * We will have 2 back-ends in HA Proxy; one for the blue servers and another for the green servers.
  * When we release an update, we will first query HA Proxy to determine the "active" color.  Then,
  * we will deploy the upgrade to the "other" / non-active color servers.
